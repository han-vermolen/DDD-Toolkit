# Project Vision

## Introduction
I strongly believe that the correct application of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) can help move the software development community to reach new heights when it comes to the quality of the product(s) we deliver. As such I have spent a good chunk of the most recent part of my career teaching and employing Domain-Driven Design.

As I led my Domain Driven Design workshops I began to notice that even though tooling support isn't strictly needed to employ DDD students did feel "lost" without at least some tools to make their life a little easier. There are all sorts of tools on the market, of course, some quite generic and by definition not tailored to a DDD learning experience, others are aimed at highly specialized practitioners. In short, all these tools just weren't ticking the right boxes.

This is why I started writing some very simple tools specifically for the students. After my first workshop sessions using the tool, I received a lot of positive feedback. Even better, I was overwhelmed by the amount of good ideas students had to improve the tool. That's the reason you are reading this right now! I feel it is my responsibility to not only improve the DDD workshop experience but also to do all these amazing ideas justice.

## Vision
The vision is rather simple. I want to **start from scratch** and build an **extendable toolkit for *learning* and *employing* Domain-Driven Design**.

## What the DDD-Toolkit is not
The goal of this project is **not** to replace (online) DDD workshops or training. It is a toolkit that can be used in conjunction with such a workshop/training.
